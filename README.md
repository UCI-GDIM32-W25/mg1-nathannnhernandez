## Devlog
1. Nathan Hernandez (he/him)
2. I assigned a plant sprite to the plant prefab. I gave our player a script that included movement and planting actions (Player). I gave the UI (PlantCountUI) a script that detected when a plant was placed and updated the UI to match the adjustment. PlantSeed() called the UpdateSeeds() method from the PlantCountUI class, which updated the UI everytime a seed was spent.
